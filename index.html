        <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
            <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
            command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
            everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
            Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
            We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
            learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
            Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
            sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
            <strong>least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.
